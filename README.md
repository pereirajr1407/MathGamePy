# MathGamePy

## Introduction

This is a simple Math Game from the Geek University Python course.

This game will generate random Math challenges based on different levels of dificulty (1, 2, 3 and 4).

The user will input the desired dificulty level, beeing 1 the easiest and 4 the hardest level and then a random math challenge will pop on the terminal.

As soon as the user answer the challenge, he will be notified if he got the correct answer (or not) and then will be asked if he wants to keep playing (or not).

## Executing the code

To run the game, simply open your terminal, go to the root folder of this project and run `python3 game.py`.

### Disclaimer:

This is a basic course project used for knowledge acquiring only but, as the developer went through the lessons for building this project, he had the idea of transforming this into a educational game for kids and teenagers.

**This project is still beeing refactored so features can be added and the code is still beeing optimized.**
